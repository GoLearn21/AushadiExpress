Below is a **clean-up patch prompt** that —

* **removes the green on-screen overlay** (logs now go only to the Expo console)
* **keeps the working “Take Photo” button** and the existing permission flow
* leaves all other functionality intact.

Copy **everything between the outer triple back-ticks** into Replit AI and run it.

############################  PATCH — STRIP ON-SCREEN DEBUG OVERLAY  ############################
Problem
───────
The DevOverlay added for camera debugging is visible in the UI, cluttering the
app. We only want console logs in DEV while keeping the “Take Photo” camera
flow that now works.

Fix
───
1. **utils/devLogger.ts**
   • Delete (or comment) the `DevOverlay` export and all `messages / bump`
     code.  
   • Keep **only**:
```ts
export const log = (...args: any[]) => {
  if (__DEV__) console.log('[CAMERA]', ...args);
};
export const push = log;   // alias so existing calls still work
````

2. **services/camera.ts**
   • `import { push } from '../utils/devLogger';` (no DevOverlay).
   • Logging calls stay the same (`push('msg')`) → console only.

3. **App.tsx**
   • Remove `<PermissionPortal />` **overlay mount** import/JSX.
   • Keep `PermissionPortal` logic, but export **nothing visible**:

```tsx
// At app root
{__DEV__ && false && <PermissionPortal />}   // overlay disabled
```

4. **Remove overlay styles**
   • Delete `bg-black/60` overlay view that wrapped green text.

5. **BarcodeScannerScreen & InvoiceScannerScreen**
   • Keep spinner / Retry button exactly as is (no change). “Take Photo” button
   remains functional.

6. **Smoke test (manual)**
   • Run in Expo preview: no green logs overlay; denying permission still shows
   modal; “Open Settings” deep-links; returning with permission granted →
   scanner opens; “Take Photo” works.

No other files changed. APK size & performance unchanged.

Begin.

Paste that block into Replit AI.  
After it runs, the green overlay will be gone, logs will show only in the
console, and camera actions (including **Take Photo**) will continue working.
